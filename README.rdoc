= Instrumental Agent

Instrument anything.

== Setup & Usage

Add the gem to your Gemfile.

  gem 'instrumental_agent'

Visit instrumentalapp.com[instrumentalapp.com] and create an account, then 
initialize the agent with your API key, found in the Docs section.

  I = Instrumental::Agent.new('YOUR_API_KEY', :test_mode => !Rails.env.production?)

We recommend setting test_mode to true in dev/test modes so that you don't pollute your production data.

Now you can begin to use Instrumental to track your application.

  I.gauge('load', 1.23)
  I.increment('signups')

Data without historical context sucks. Instrumental lets you 
backfill data, allowing you to see deep into your project's past.

  User.find_each do |user|
    I.increment('signups', 1, user.created_at)
  end

Want some general server stats (load, memory, etc.)? Run this command, sorry not daemonized yet :)

  instrument_server

Running under Rails? You can also give our experimental Rack middleware 
a shot by initializing it with:

  Instrumental::Middleware.boot

Need to quickly disable the agent? set :enabled to false on initialization and you don't need to change any application code.
